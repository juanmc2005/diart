## Installation

1) Create environment:

```shell
conda create -n diart python=3.8
conda activate diart
```

2) Install `PortAudio` and `soundfile`:

```shell
conda install portaudio
conda install pysoundfile -c conda-forge
```

3) [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally)

4) Install pyannote.audio 2.0

```shell
pip install pyannote.audio
```

**Note:** starting from version 0.4, installing pyannote.audio is mandatory to run the default system or to use pyannote-based models. In any other case, this step can be ignored.

5) Install diart:
```shell
pip install diart
```

## Stream audio

### From the command line

A recorded conversation:

```shell
diart.stream /path/to/audio.wav
```

A live conversation:

```shell
diart.stream microphone
```

See `diart.stream -h` for more options.

### From python

Run a real-time speaker diarization pipeline over an audio stream with `RealTimeInference`:

```python
from diart.sources import MicrophoneAudioSource
from diart.inference import RealTimeInference
from diart.pipelines import OnlineSpeakerDiarization, PipelineConfig

config = PipelineConfig()  # Default parameters
pipeline = OnlineSpeakerDiarization(config)
audio_source = MicrophoneAudioSource(config.sample_rate)
inference = RealTimeInference("/output/path", do_plot=True)
inference(pipeline, audio_source)
```

For faster inference and evaluation on a dataset we recommend to use `Benchmark` instead (see our notes on [reproducibility](#reproducibility)).

## Add your model

Third-party segmentation and embedding models can be integrated seamlessly by subclassing `SegmentationModel` and `EmbeddingModel`:

```python
import torch
from typing import Optional
from diart.models import EmbeddingModel
from diart.pipelines import PipelineConfig, OnlineSpeakerDiarization
from diart.sources import MicrophoneAudioSource
from diart.inference import RealTimeInference

class MyEmbeddingModel(EmbeddingModel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.my_pretrained_model = load("my_model.ckpt")
    
    def __call__(
        self,
        waveform: torch.Tensor,
        weights: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None
    ) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.my_pretrained_model(waveform, weights)

config = PipelineConfig(embedding=MyEmbeddingModel())
pipeline = OnlineSpeakerDiarization(config)
mic = MicrophoneAudioSource(config.sample_rate)
inference = RealTimeInference("/out/dir")
inference(pipeline, mic)
```

## Tune hyper-parameters

Diart implements a hyper-parameter optimizer based on [optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) that allows you to tune any pipeline to any dataset.

### From the command line

```shell
diart.tune /wav/dir --reference /rttm/dir --output /out/dir
```

See `diart.tune -h` for more options.

### From python

```python
from diart.optim import Optimizer, TauActive, RhoUpdate, DeltaNew
from diart.pipelines import PipelineConfig
from diart.inference import Benchmark

# Benchmark runs and evaluates the pipeline on a dataset
benchmark = Benchmark("/wav/dir", "/rttm/dir", "/out/dir/tmp", show_report=False)
# Base configuration for the pipeline we're going to tune
base_config = PipelineConfig()
# Hyper-parameters to optimize
hparams = [TauActive, RhoUpdate, DeltaNew]
# Optimizer implements the optimization loop
optimizer = Optimizer(benchmark, base_config, hparams, "/out/dir")
# Run optimization
optimizer.optimize(num_iter=100, show_progress=True)
```

This will use `/out/dir/tmp` as a working directory and write results to an sqlite database in `/out/dir`.

### Distributed optimization

For bigger datasets, it is sometimes more convenient to run multiple optimization processes in parallel.
To do this, create a study on a [recommended DBMS](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/10_key_features/004_distributed.html#sphx-glr-tutorial-10-key-features-004-distributed-py) (e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL) making sure that the study and database names match:

```shell
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS example"
optuna create-study --study-name "example" --storage "mysql://root@localhost/example"
```

Then you can run multiple identical optimizers pointing to the database:

```shell
diart.tune /wav/dir --reference /rttm/dir --output /out/dir --storage mysql://root@localhost/example
```

If you are using the python API, make sure that worker directories are different to avoid concurrency issues:

```python
from diart.optim import Optimizer
from diart.inference import Benchmark
from optuna.samplers import TPESampler
import optuna

ID = 0  # Worker identifier
base_config, hparams = ...
benchmark = Benchmark("/wav/dir", "/rttm/dir", f"/out/dir/worker-{ID}", show_report=False)
study = optuna.load_study("example", "mysql://root@localhost/example", TPESampler())
optimizer = Optimizer(benchmark, base_config, hparams, study)
optimizer.optimize(num_iter=100, show_progress=True)
```

## Build pipelines

For a more advanced usage, diart also provides building blocks that can be combined to create your own pipeline.
Streaming is powered by [RxPY](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY), but the `blocks` module is completely independent and can be used separately.

### Example

Obtain overlap-aware speaker embeddings from a microphone stream:

```python
import rx.operators as ops
import diart.operators as dops
from diart.sources import MicrophoneAudioSource
from diart.blocks import SpeakerSegmentation, OverlapAwareSpeakerEmbedding

segmentation = SpeakerSegmentation.from_pyannote("pyannote/segmentation")
embedding = OverlapAwareSpeakerEmbedding.from_pyannote("pyannote/embedding")
sample_rate = segmentation.model.get_sample_rate()
mic = MicrophoneAudioSource(sample_rate)

stream = mic.stream.pipe(
    # Reformat stream to 5s duration and 500ms shift
    dops.regularize_audio_stream(sample_rate),
    ops.map(lambda wav: (wav, segmentation(wav))),
    ops.starmap(embedding)
).subscribe(on_next=lambda emb: print(emb.shape))

mic.read()
```

Output:

```
torch.Size([4, 512])
torch.Size([4, 512])
torch.Size([4, 512])
...
```

## WebSockets

Diart is also compatible with the WebSocket protocol so you can serve your pipeline on the web.

In the following example we build a minimal server so a client can send audio to the remote pipeline and then receive a prediction in RTTM format:

```python
import rx.operators as ops
import diart.operators as dops
from diart.pipelines import OnlineSpeakerDiarization, PipelineConfig
from diart.sources import WebSocketAudioSource

config = PipelineConfig()
source = WebSocketAudioSource(config.sample_rate, "localhost", 7007)
pipeline = OnlineSpeakerDiarization(config)

pipeline.from_audio_source(source).pipe(
    dops.progress(f"Streaming from {source.uri}", unit="chunk"),
    ops.starmap(lambda ann, _: ann.to_rttm()),
    ops.filter(lambda rttm: bool(rttm)),  # Ignore non-speech
).subscribe(source.send)

source.read()
```

## Powered by research

Diart is the official implementation of the paper *[Overlap-aware low-latency online speaker diarization based on end-to-end local segmentation](/paper.pdf)* by [Juan Manuel Coria](https://juanmc2005.github.io/), [Hervé Bredin](https://herve.niderb.fr), [Sahar Ghannay](https://saharghannay.github.io/) and [Sophie Rosset](https://perso.limsi.fr/rosset/).


> We propose to address online speaker diarization as a combination of incremental clustering and local diarization applied to a rolling buffer updated every 500ms. Every single step of the proposed pipeline is designed to take full advantage of the strong ability of a recently proposed end-to-end overlap-aware segmentation to detect and separate overlapping speakers. In particular, we propose a modified version of the statistics pooling layer (initially introduced in the x-vector architecture) to give less weight to frames where the segmentation model predicts simultaneous speakers. Furthermore, we derive cannot-link constraints from the initial segmentation step to prevent two local speakers from being wrongfully merged during the incremental clustering step. Finally, we show how the latency of the proposed approach can be adjusted between 500ms and 5s to match the requirements of a particular use case, and we provide a systematic analysis of the influence of latency on the overall performance (on AMI, DIHARD and VoxConverse).

##  Reproducibility

![Results table](/table1.png)

Diart aims to be lightweight and capable of real-time streaming in practical scenarios.
Its performance is very close to what is reported in the paper (and sometimes even a bit better).

To obtain the best results, make sure to use the following hyper-parameters:

| Dataset     | latency | tau    | rho    | delta |
|-------------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| DIHARD III  | any     | 0.555  | 0.422  | 1.517 |
| AMI         | any     | 0.507  | 0.006  | 1.057 |
| VoxConverse | any     | 0.576  | 0.915  | 0.648 |
| DIHARD II   | 1s      | 0.619  | 0.326  | 0.997 |
| DIHARD II   | 5s      | 0.555  | 0.422  | 1.517 |

`diart.benchmark` and `diart.inference.Benchmark` can quickly run and evaluate the pipeline, and even measure its real-time latency. For instance, for a DIHARD III configuration:

```shell
diart.benchmark /wav/dir --reference /rttm/dir --tau=0.555 --rho=0.422 --delta=1.517 --output /out/dir
```

or using the inference API:

```python
from diart.inference import Benchmark
from diart.pipelines import OnlineSpeakerDiarization, PipelineConfig

config = PipelineConfig(
    step=0.5,
    latency=0.5,
    tau_active=0.555,
    rho_update=0.422,
    delta_new=1.517
)
pipeline = OnlineSpeakerDiarization(config)
benchmark = Benchmark("/wav/dir", "/rttm/dir", "/out/dir")

benchmark(pipeline)
```

This runs a faster inference by pre-calculating model outputs in batches.
See `diart.benchmark -h` for more options.

For convenience and to facilitate future comparisons, we also provide the [expected outputs](/expected_outputs) of the paper implementation in RTTM format for every entry of Table 1 and Figure 5. This includes the VBx offline topline as well as our proposed online approach with latencies 500ms, 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s.
